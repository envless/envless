Have you ever spent hours or even days trying to track down a pesky bug in your code? As developers, we've all been there, and we know how frustrating it can be. But what if I told you that there's a tool you can use to significantly reduce the time it takes to solve these problems and improve your development speed? That tool is Github.

Debugging can be one of the most time-consuming aspects of software development. Some estimates suggest that developers spend up to 80% of a project's lifespan just trying to find solutions to their problems. That's a lot of time! But by acquiring good debugging skills, you can reduce this time and save yourself a lot of headaches.

In this article, I'll show you some proven ways to use Github to find solutions to your coding problems quickly and efficiently. By taking advantage of the tools and resources available on Github, you can reduce the time it takes to solve coding problems, improve your development speed, and build better software in less time. I'll share two case studies of how I used Github to reduce the time it would have taken me to solve my problem by more than 50% and show you how you can apply these solutions to your own projects.

## A Proven Method for Effective Problem Solving with Github

When implementing a feature in your project, follow a methodical approach to ensure that you are clear on the steps needed to achieve your goals. However, sometimes even the best-laid plans can run into issues, and this is where Github comes in.

When you encounter a bug or unexpected behaviour while coding, your first step should be to re-read the documentation related to the feature you are working on. If this doesn't provide a solution, turn to Github. Specifically, navigate to the issues page for the relevant library you are using and search for keywords related to your problem.

More often than not, you will find that others have faced the exact same issue or something similar.

## Does it always work?

No, this approach of using Github to solve coding problems doesn't always work, but I find that it can be effective about 70% of the time. Even when I don't find a direct solution, I gain more context on the problem, which helps me describe it better and receive help from other developers.

In the upcoming case study, I will provide a step-by-step guide on how I used Github to solve problems quickly. I will use a bug I encountered a few days ago while contributing to the Envless library on GitHub as an example. It is worth noting that the project leverages the tRPC library to bridge communication between its API and client, which is a library that facilitates the creation and consumption of fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

> tRPC allows you to easily build & consume fully typesafe APIs without schemas or code generation.

The “t” in tRPC stands for “TypeScript,” which is a programming language that provides static type checking and other features to help catch errors before runtime. The “RPC” stands for “Remote Procedure Call,” which is a technique used to communicate between different parts of a system, similar to how functions or methods are called within a single programme.

So, you can think of tRPC as a bridge between different parts of your application, allowing them to communicate with each other in a type-safe and structured way.

## Step 1 Finding a Repository on Github

Searching for repositories on Github is a breeze. All you need to do is conduct a Google search using the library name and append the word “Github” at the end. Alternatively, if the project has an official website, you can easily find the Github link on their social media pages.

To gain insight into a project, start with the README file. This file typically provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to use it.

Once you have found a repository, navigating its issues tab can help you gain an understanding of common bugs, feature requests, and other discussions surrounding the project. You can find the issues tab at the top left corner of the repository's home page.

## Step 2 Github Debugging Techniques

1. ### Code search functionality

   When facing an issue with a project, Github provides several useful features to help you track down the problem. One of these features is the code search functionality. You can access this by going to the Issues tab and using the search box to filter issues based on various criteria, including closed issues.

   ![Screenshot Highlighting the Search box for tRPC issues on Github](/blogs/posts/screenshot-highlighting-the-search-box-for-trpc-issues-on-github.png "Screenshot Highlighting the Search box for tRPC issues on Github")

2. ### Pull Requests

   Github's pull requests can be a valuable resource for finding solutions to similar problems.

   For example, I needed to add a screen sharing feature to a video conferencing app I was developing in React Native using the `react-native-twilio-video-webrtc` library. After discovering that the main repository did not have this feature working for Android, I checked the pull request page and found that someone had attempted to implement it.

   I forked the pull request, synced it with the main branch, made some fixes, and my app worked. Using Github's pull requests can save time and effort when trying to solve complex problems in a project.

3. ### Github's discussions feature to ask for help

   To use Github's discussions feature to ask for help, navigate to the discussions tab on the repository's page. Then, create a new discussion and title it with a clear and concise description of your problem.

   In the body of the discussion, provide relevant details such as the steps you've taken to try and solve the problem, error messages you're receiving, and any other relevant information.

   Make sure to tag the discussion with appropriate labels so that it's easy for others to find and offer help. Be patient and check back frequently for responses and updates.

## A real example of debugging code from Github using the techniques outlined above

In this case study, I had the opportunity to join the Envless team as a contributor and help with an open issue.

Envless is a very exciting project that you should look into. It is a developer tool that helps manage your environmental variables outside your computer, it's open source and it makes it very easy to share and manage app secrets across teams.

If you are interested in open-source software or are looking to make your first contribution, there are many good first issues you can contribute to.

The task was to modify the project routes to use a unique project slug instead of a project id. This required adding a new column called “slug” in the projects table and implementing a validation feature where users would enter characters in an input field and it would validate their input every 500 milliseconds.

To accomplish this, we utilised the tRPC library, which allowed for easy and secure communication between the API and client. In the `trpc/routes/projects.ts` file, a new method was introduced, `checkSlugAvailability`:

```ts
export const projects = createRouter({
  getAll: withAuth.query(({ ctx }) => {
    return; // ... Get all projects, with pagination
  }),
  getOne: withAuth.input(z.object({ id: z.number() })).query(({ input }) => {
    return; // ... Get one project with the id
  }),
  checkSlugAvailability: withAuth
    .input(z.object({ slug: z.string(), name: z.string() }))
    .query(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      const { slug } = input;
      const existingProject = await ctx.prisma.project.findUnique({
        where: {
          slug,
        },
      });
      return existingProject ? false : true;
    }),
  // ... others
});
```

The code above contains a method called `checkSlugAvailability`, which serves to validate user input on the backend. It takes in one parameter, namely the `slug`, which is a string. The function checks whether a project with the given `slug` already exists in the database by querying the Prisma ORM. If an existing project is found, the function returns `false`, indicating that the `slug` is already taken; otherwise, it returns `true`, indicating that the `slug` is available for use.

On the client side, when creating a project, the create project modal had this code:

```tsx
// Imports

const CreateProjectModal = () => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const {
    reset,
    setError,
    register,
    handleSubmit,
    formState: { errors },
  } = useForm();
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);

  // Pay attention to the useMutaion hook
  const projectMutation = trpc.projects.create.useMutation({
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      const { id } = data;
      router.push(`/projects/${id}`);
    },
    onError: (error) => {
      if (error.message.includes("Unique constraint failed")) {
        setError("name", {
          type: "custom",
          message: "Project name already exists",
        });
      }

      setLoading(false);
    },
  });

  const createNewProject: SubmitHandler<Project> = async (data) => {
    const { name } = data;
    setLoading(true);

    if (!name) {
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }

    projectMutation.mutate({ project: { name: name } });
    reset();
  };

  return (
    <Modal
      button={
        <Button>
          <Plus className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" aria-hidden="true" />
          New project
        </Button>
      }
      title="Create a new project"
    >
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(createNewProject)}>
        <Input
          name="name"
          label="Project name"
          placeholder="Untitled"
          required={true}
          full={true}
          register={register}
          errors={errors}
          validationSchema={{
            required: "Project name is required",
          }}
        />
        <div className="float-right">
          <Button disabled={loading}>
            Save and continue
            <ArrowRight className="ml-2 h-5 w-5" aria-hidden="true" />
          </Button>
        </div>
      </form>
    </Modal>
  );
};
```

This component is built using Zod and React Hook Forms to validate user input. While there are some helpful functions destructured from the useForm hook, our main focus is the `createNewProject` function. It uses the `projectMutation.mutate` function which is returned after calling `useMutation` on `trpc.projects.create`, a React hook.

**React hooks have rules** which we are going to talk about soon in this article, but for now, let's discuss my initial attempt to add a slug to the project and how GitHub issues helped me solve a problem quickly.

Here's the code for my first attempt:

```ts
Project {
   name: string;
   slug: string;
}

const CreateProjectModal = () => {
   const router = useRouter();
   const {
     reset,
     setError,
     register,
     handleSubmit,
     formState: { errors },
     clearErrors,
     setValue,
     watch,
   } = useForm();
   const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
   const [kebabSlug, setKebabSlug] = useState("");

   // Watch for changes in the name and slug field
   const watchName = watch("name");
   const watchSlug = watch("slug");

   // Nothing changed
   const projectMutation = trpc.projects.create.useMutation({
     onSuccess: (data) => {
       const { id } = data;
       router.push(`/projects/${id}`);
     },
      onError: (error) => {
       if (error.message.includes("Unique constraint failed")) {
         setError("name", {
           type: "custom",
           message: "Project name already exists",
         });
       }
        setLoading(false);
     },
   });

    // Add slug to create project
    const createNewProject: SubmitHandler<Project> = async (data) => {
     const { name, slug } = data;
     setLoading(true);
      if (!name || !slug) {
       setLoading(false);
       return;
     }
      projectMutation.mutate({ project: { name, slug } });
     reset();
   };

   // Watch for changes in the name to and convert it to Kabab case for slug
   // E.g Cool Project name => cool-project-name
    useEffect(() => {
     if (!watchName) {
       setValue("slug", "");
       return;
     }
     const kebabName = kebabCase(watchName);
     setKebabSlug(kebabName);
     setValue("slug", kebabName);
   }, [watchName, setValue]);


   // When user enter slug value manually, convert to Kabab case
    useEffect(() => {
     if (!watchSlug) clearErrors(["slug"]);
     const kebabSlug = kebabCase(watchSlug);
      setKebabSlug(kebabSlug);
   }, [watchSlug, setValue, clearErrors]);


   // I will take this into its own code block to highlight the problem
   useEffect(() => {
     const timeoutId = setTimeout(async () => {
       if (kebabSlug) {
           // Focus on the useQuery hook
         const isSlugAvailable = await trpc.projects.checkSlugAvailability.useQuery({
           slug: kebabSlug,
         });

         if (!isSlugAvailable) {
           setError("slug", { message: "This slug is not available" });
         } else {
           clearErrors(["slug"]);
         }
       }
     }, 500);
     return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
     // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
   }, [kebabSlug, setError]);
```

Changes were made to the `CreateProjectModal` component to include state variables and `useEffect` hooks to validate the user's input for the project name and slug.

The project object now includes a `slug` property. The use of the `useForm` hook and it's destructured functions have not changed much.

The `createNewProject` function calls the `projectMutation.mutate` function which is returned after calling `useMutation` on `trpc.projects.create`. There are three main `useEffect` hooks, the first sets the `slug` value to a kebab-case version of the project name, the second converts the users manual entry in the `slug` field to kebab-case and the last one runs a query to check the availability of the slug and sets an error message if it is not available.

```ts
// I will take this into its own code block to highlight the problem
useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(async () => {
    if (kebabSlug) {
      // Focus on the useQuery hook, I commited an offense
      const isSlugAvailable = await projects.checkSlugAvailability.useQuery({
        slug: kebabSlug,
      });
      if (!isSlugAvailable) {
        setError("slug", { message: "This slug is not available" });
      } else {
        clearErrors(["slug"]);
      }
    }
  }, 500);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [kebabSlug, setError]);
```

This code calls `projects.checkSlugAvailability` 500 milliseconds after the user has finished typing. This function sends a request to the server to check if the entered slug is available.

### The problem

I was just using tRPC for the first time, and I lacked an understanding of its essential APIs. But I knew I was breaking the rules of react hooks. And React did yell at me for breaking the rules.

I broke two rules here:

1. I called useQuery in a condition
2. I called useQuery in an effect.

### The Rules of Hooks in React

In React, any function that starts with ‘use' and is called inside a function component is considered a hook and must follow certain rules:

1. Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns.

2. Don't call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can call Hooks from React function components or custom Hooks.
   If you're curious about why React enforces these rules, I'll share all the resources used in this article at the end.

### Welcome back

Because of the rules of using react hooks, I had to find a way to modify this line of code:

```ts
const isSlugAvailable = await trpc.projects.checkSlugAvailability.useQuery({
  slug: kebabSlug,
});
```

I had to come up with an alternative solution as using the `useQuery` hook was not allowed in the current scenario.

I started my search by following the steps mentioned earlier. I navigated to GitHub and searched for the tRPC repository. Then, I searched for the query **“Fetch api without hooks”** in the repository's issues section.

![tRPC Example result in Github Search](/blogs/posts/trpc-example-result-in-github-search.png "tRPC Example result in Github Search")

Of course, I had to use different search terms before I could get the correct one. The result?

![Screenshot of a Solution after Searching on Github Issues](/blogs/posts/screenshot-of-a-solution-after-searching-on-github-issues.png "Screenshot of a Solution after Searching on Github Issues")

I came across the `useContext` hook that provides access to the client object at the top level of the application. With this, I made the following modification to my code:

```ts
const { projects } = trpc.useContext();

// ...Others

useEffect(() => {
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(async () => {
    if (kebabSlug) {
      // Now we cam remove useQuery from replace projects.checkSlugAvailability
      const isSlugAvailable = await projects.checkSlugAvailability.fetch({
        slug: kebabSlug,
      });
      if (!isSlugAvailable) {
        setError("slug", { message: "This slug is not available" });
      } else {
        clearErrors(["slug"]);
      }
    }
  }, 500);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  // eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
}, [kebabSlug, setError]);

// ...Others
```

I used the fetch method that is available within the `checkSlugAvailability` function, and it worked perfectly.

## What should I do if I don't find the results of my search?

If I wasn't able to find the results of my search, my next step would be to turn to other resources such as ChatGPT, StackOverflow, and any other relevant tutorials I could find. It's always important to exhaust all available resources when trying to solve a problem.

## Conclusion
