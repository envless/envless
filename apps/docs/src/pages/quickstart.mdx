- [Signup for an account](#signup-for-an-account)

## Signup for an account

If you haven't already, you will need to [sign up for an account](https://envless.dev/signup) to get started with the Envless. You can sign up for free and get started right away. You can signup using your email address, using your GitHub or GitLab account.

## Create your first project

{/* Reword following paragraph */}
Go to [projects](https://envless.dev/projects) page and create your first project. You will need to provide a name for your project.

## Download your Private Key

After you create your first project, you will be asked to download the Private key. This private key will be used to encrypt and decrypt your environment variables. We will walk you through the process of securing your private key in the next section.
