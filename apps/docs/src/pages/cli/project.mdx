COMMANDS
  $ project link    Link your development project to the Envless project.

## Link

From your project's root directory run following command to link your project with Envless:

<CodeGroup title="Link your project with Envless project">
  ```bash {{ title: 'Command', language: 'bash' }}
  envless project link --projectId xxxxxxxx
  ```

```bash {{ title: 'Help', language: 'bash' }}
$ envless project link --help

Link your development project to the Envless project.

USAGE
  $ envless project link [-p <value>] [-b <value>] [-h]

FLAGS
  -b, --branch=<value>     [default: development] Envless project branch name
  -h, --help               Show help for the link command
  -p, --projectId=<value>  Envless Project ID

DESCRIPTION
  Link your development project to the Envless project.
  ⚡ Please make sure you are running this command from your development project root
  directory and have created a project. If you have not, create one at
  https://go.envless.dev/projects

EXAMPLES
  $ envless project link
  $ envless project link --projectId xxxxxxxx
  $ envless project link --projectId xxxxxxxx --branch development
```

</CodeGroup>

When you link your project with Envless, it will create a `.envless.yml` file in your project's root directory. This directory will contain the project id and branch name. You can change the branch name in this file to point to a different branch. Its recommended to commit this file to your project's repository.

```yaml {{ title: '.envless.yml' }}
branch: development
projectId: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Note>
  For IaaS providers with Docker, K8S and others, PaaS (Vercel, Supabase,
  Netlify and others) and CI/CD pipelines (Github actions, Gitlab CI/CD, Circle
  CI and others), you can use ENV variables to initialize Envless CLI.
</Note>

```bash {{ title: 'Envless ENV variables', language: 'bash' }}
export ENVLESS_CLI_ID=xxxxxxxx
export ENVLESS_CLI_TOKEN=xxxxxxxx
export ENVLESS_PROJECT_ID=xxxxxxxx
export ENVLESS_BRANCH_NAME=xxxxxxxx
export ENVLESS_PRIVATE_KEY="
  -----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----
  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
"
```

## Create

To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup title="Create a project">
```bash {{ title: 'Command', language: 'bash' }}
envless project create --name xxxxxxxx
```

```bash {{ title: 'Help', language: 'bash' }}
$ envless project create --help

Create a new Envless project.

USAGE
  $ envless project create [-n <value>]

FLAGS
  -n, --name=<value>  This is the project\'s name
