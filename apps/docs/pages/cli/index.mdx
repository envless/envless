- This will open the `https://envless.dev/cli/auth` page in your default web browser.
- Enter your email address when prompted.
- You will receive a secure login link via email.
- If you do not already have an Envless account, you will be asked to create a public/private encryption key.
- This private key will be securely saved on your device for future use with the Envless CLI.
- If you already have an Envless account, the authentication process will be completed and you will be able to use the CLI.
