## Start your server

To securely inject app secrets (ENV variables) for your project, use the `envless start` command followed by the command that you would normally use to start your server.

For example, if you are using Node.js and you would normally start your server with `npm start` , you would use the following command:

<Tabs items={["Terminal", "Help"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```sh filename="Terminal" copy
    envless start --command 'npm start'

    # or with alias and short flag
    envless s -c 'npm start'
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```ts filename="Help"
    $ envless start --help

    Inject environment variables and run a command.
    This command can be used to start your application locally,
    on a CI/CD pipeline, platforms or anywhere else.

    USAGE
      $ envless start -r <value> [-h]

    FLAGS
      -h, --help         Show help for the start command
      -r, --run=<value>  (required) The command to run

    ALIASES
      $ envless s

    EXAMPLES
      $ envless s -r "yarn dev"
      $ envless start --run "npm run start"
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This command is programming language, framework, platform, infrastructure agnostic and can be used in any environment, such as **development**, **production**, **staging**, **review apps**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **platforms**, **infrastructures**, etc. Please be sure to follow the steps below to setup Envless CLI for your environment.

- [Setup Envless CLI for development environment](/platform/projects/setup)
- [Setup Envless CLI for production and other environments](/platform/projects/setup)

### How it works?

When you run the `envless run` command, Envless CLI will:

1. Pull down encrypted ENV variables from our EDGE Network API.
2. Decrypt these this End to end encrypted variables with your private key.
3. Inject ENV variables and start your application.

By following these simple steps, you can easily and securely start your server with the ENV variables that you need for your project.
