## Initialize Envless

To initialize Envless in your project, simply run the `envless init` command from your terminal. Before running this command, ensure that you are in your project's root directory.

<Tabs items={["Terminal", "Help"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```ts filename="Terminal" copy
    envless init
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab>
    ```ts filename="Help"
    $ envless init --help

    Initialize Envless CLI

    USAGE
      $ envless init [-i <value>] [-t <value>] [-h]

    FLAGS
      -h, --help           Show help for the init command
      -i, --id=<value>     Cli ID
      -t, --token=<value>  Cli Token

    DESCRIPTION
      Initialize Envless CLI
      âš¡ Please make sure you have created a project and setup CLI id and token on the
      dashboard.

    EXAMPLES
      $ envless init
      $ envless init --id xxxxxxxx --token xxxxxxxx
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

When you run the `envless init` command, a new `.envless.yml` file will be created in your project's root directory. This file will contain your project ID and the name of the branch. Branch name will be `development` by default. Please note that you can change the branch name in the `.envless.yml` file.

Here's an example of how the `.envless` file might look:

```yml filename=".envless.yml"
branch: "development"
projectId: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

By following these simple steps, you can quickly and easily initialize Envless in your project and start managing your environment variables with ease.
