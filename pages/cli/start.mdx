## Start your server

To securely inject ENV variables for your project, use the `envless -r` command followed by the command that you would normally use to start your server.

Here's an example of how to start your server using Envless:

{/* TODO - please add other languages and frameworks */}
| Language/Framework | Before | After |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Node.js | `npm start` | `envless -r npm start` |
| Laravel | `php artisan serve` | `envless -r php artisan serve` |
| Ruby on Rails | `rails start` | `envless -r rails start` |

Note that this is just a small sample of the many languages and frameworks that Envless works with. To get started with other languages or frameworks, please refer to their respective documentation.

### How it works?
When you run the `envless -r` command, Envless CLI will:

1. Pull down encrypted ENV variables from our EDGE Network API.
2. Decrypt these this End to end encrypted variables with your private key.
3. Inject ENV variables and start your application.

By following these simple steps, you can easily and securely start your server with the ENV variables that you need for your project.
