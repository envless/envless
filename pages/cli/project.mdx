## Project CLI Commands
With Envless CLI, you can easily create and update projects.

### Creating a new project
To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs items={["Terminal"]}>
  <Tab>``` envless project create ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

This command will prompt you for the necessary information to create the project, including the project name, description, and any team members you want to add to the project.

### Updating a project
To update an existing project, run the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs items={["Terminal"]}>
  <Tab>``` envless project update ```</Tab>
</Tabs>

This command will update the project with any changes you've made to your local `.envless` file, including changes to the project ID, branch, or any environment variables. You can modify the `.envless` file directly to make these changes.

Note that you must have appropriate permissions to create or update a project.
